# Create Custom Command

This task helps you create a new custom command file with proper structure and formatting.

## Process

1. Gather command information:
   - Ask the user what the purpose of the command is
   - Based on the purpose, suggest an appropriate filename and title
     - Format: `N-descriptive-name.md` (where N is the next available number)
     - Ensure the filename is lowercase, uses hyphens for spaces, and is descriptive
   - Confirm the suggested name or allow the user to specify a different one

2. Determine command structure:
   - Suggest a structure based on the command's purpose
   - Present common command patterns:
     1. Simple task command (few steps, direct execution)
     2. Multi-step workflow (sequential steps with decision points)
     3. Analytical command (analyzes code and provides recommendations)
     4. Generation command (creates new files or content)
   - Ask which pattern is closest to the desired command

3. Create command file:
   - Use the standard command file template:

     ```markdown

     title: 'Command Title'
     read_only: true
     type: 'command'

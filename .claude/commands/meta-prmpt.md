# Meta-Prompt: GitHub Issue Template Generator

We just got access to advanced AI capabilities and need to streamline our feature development process.

Create a comprehensive prompt template that I can reuse to transform simple feature ideas into detailed GitHub Issues. This template should:

1. Automatically research our existing codebase for relevant patterns
2. Search the web for best practices and open-source implementations
3. Generate complete project specifications including:
   - Problem statements and user stories
   - Technical requirements and implementation plans
   - Testing strategies and acceptance criteria
   - Risk assessment and dependencies

The output should be a reusable prompt that I can customize with any feature description and it will handle all the research and documentation automatically.

Make this prompt detailed enough that even complex features get properly scoped, but structured so the output is actionable for developers.

### üìù Feature Overview

- **Problem Statement:** The Nuxt application needs to connect to a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM through the Session Pooler. Currently, the database connection is partially configured but lacks proper schema definitions, environment validation, server API routes, and client-side composables.

- **Solution Vision:** Implement a robust, type-safe database layer using Drizzle ORM connected to Supabase PostgreSQL via the Session Pooler. This will include proper environment configuration, Drizzle schema definitions mirroring the existing SQL schema, Nitro server plugins for connection management, server API routes for database operations, and client-side composables for seamless data access. All database requests will be routed through the server layer for security and consistency.

- **Success Metrics:**
  - All database tables from the SQL schema are represented as Drizzle schemas with full TypeScript support
  - Database connections use the Session Pooler with proper connection pooling
  - Zero runtime database connection errors
  - Type-safe database queries throughout the application
  - Successful CRUD operations on the Zymes table

### üë• User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to query the database using type-safe Drizzle ORM methods so that I can avoid runtime SQL errors
2. As a developer, I want environment variables properly validated so that missing configuration is caught at startup
3. As a front-end developer, I want easy-to-use composables for database operations so that I can focus on UI implementation
4. As a system administrator, I want proper connection pooling through the Session Pooler so that the database handles concurrent requests efficiently
5. As a developer, I want automatic TypeScript types generated from the database schema so that I maintain type safety across the stack

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- **UI / UX:**
  - Database operations should be transparent to the UI layer
  - Loading states properly handled during database queries
  - Error states gracefully displayed to users
  - No visible latency for standard queries

- **Performance:**
  - Connection pooling properly configured with Session Pooler
  - Prepared statements disabled for Transaction pool mode compatibility
  - Efficient query patterns using Drizzle's query builder
  - Proper indexing utilized through the ORM

- **Accessibility:**
  - Error messages are clear and actionable
  - Loading states announced to screen readers
  - Database operations don't block UI interactions

- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Database credentials stored securely in environment variables
  - All database requests routed through server-side API routes
  - No direct database access from client
  - No SQL injection vulnerabilities through proper parameterization
  - Service role key kept server-side only

### üîß Technical Requirements

- **Architectural Approach:**
  - Drizzle ORM with postgres.js driver for database operations
  - Nitro plugin pattern for connection management
  - Server API routes for all database operations
  - Client-side composables wrapping API calls
  - Environment validation using Zod schema
  - No direct client-to-database connections

- **Data-Model / Schema Changes:**
  - Convert existing SQL schema to Drizzle schema definitions
  - Create all enum types as Drizzle enums
  - Define all table relationships
  - Generate TypeScript types from schemas

- **API Endpoints (if any):**
  - `/api/zymes` - Full CRUD operations for Zymes
    - GET `/api/zymes` - List all zymes
    - GET `/api/zymes/:id` - Get single zyme
    - POST `/api/zymes` - Create new zyme
    - PUT `/api/zymes/:id` - Update zyme
    - DELETE `/api/zymes/:id` - Delete zyme
  - Additional endpoints to be added as needed

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - Supabase PostgreSQL database with Session Pooler
  - Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit
  - postgres.js driver

- **Key Security Considerations:**
  - Validate all environment variables at startup
  - Use parameterized queries exclusively
  - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
  - All database operations server-side only
  - Authentication to be added in future iteration

### üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test Drizzle schema definitions match SQL schema
  - Test environment validation logic
  - Test database query builders
  - Test error handling in API routes

- **Integration / E2E Tests:**
  - Test database connection establishment
  - Test CRUD operations for Zymes entity
  - Test transaction handling
  - Test connection pool behavior under load

- **Manual QA Checklist:**
  - Verify all environment variables are properly loaded
  - Test Zymes CRUD operations return expected data
  - Verify TypeScript types match database schema
  - Test error scenarios (connection failure, invalid queries)
  - Confirm no direct database access from client

- **Performance / Load Tests:**
  - Test connection pool limits
  - Measure query response times
  - Test concurrent request handling
  - Monitor memory usage under load

### ‚ùì Open Questions

- ~~Should we use Supabase Auth for RLS or handle authentication separately?~~ **Answer: Authentication will be added in a separate request later**
- ~~Do we need real-time subscriptions initially or just REST operations?~~ **Answer: REST operations only for now**
- ~~Should we implement caching layer (Redis/KV) for frequently accessed data?~~ **Answer: Deferred to future iteration**
- ~~Which entities need full CRUD operations vs read-only access?~~ **Answer: CRUD for Zymes table initially, others as needed**
- ~~Should we use Supabase client library alongside Drizzle for specific features?~~ **Answer: All database requests should be routed through the server, not the client**
